## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Flutter, Dart

The Affine Cipher Cryptography App is built using the Flutter framework, allowing for cross-platform development of mobile applications. Here's an overview of the technologies and techniques used in the project:

Flutter: The entire app is developed using the Flutter framework, which provides a rich set of UI components and tools for building beautiful and performant mobile applications.

Dart: The programming language used in the Flutter framework is Dart. Dart's simplicity and powerful features allow for efficient development and easy maintenance of the app.

Affine Cipher Algorithm: The app implements the Affine Cipher algorithm, which is a substitution cipher that combines modular arithmetic and linear functions to encrypt and decrypt messages. The algorithm provides a secure way to transform plaintext into ciphertext and vice versa.

The app includes features such as message encryption and decryption, customizable encryption keys, and a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction with the Affine Cipher cryptography functionality.

## Optimizations

While developing the Affine Cipher Cryptography App, I implemented several optimizations to improve its performance and user experience:

Efficient Encryption and Decryption: The Affine Cipher algorithm is optimized for fast encryption and decryption of messages. I ensured that the implementation is efficient and does not introduce unnecessary delays, providing a smooth experience for users.

UI Responsiveness: The app's user interface is designed to be responsive and provide real-time feedback to users. I optimized UI components and animations to ensure smooth transitions and a seamless user experience.

Error Handling: Robust error handling mechanisms are implemented to handle various scenarios, such as invalid inputs or unexpected errors. Users are provided with clear and informative error messages, enhancing the reliability of the app.

Code Optimization: Throughout the development process, I optimized the codebase by eliminating redundant code, improving algorithms, and following Flutter's best practices. These optimizations enhance the app's performance and maintainability.

These optimizations contribute to an efficient and user-friendly experience, ensuring that the Affine Cipher Cryptography App delivers accurate and secure encryption and decryption functionality.
